# EE Tech Test

IMPORTANT: The tests were written with my opinions in full force therefore they fail based on the functional requirements specified.
This was to ensure I could write enough code to demonstrate what I wanted to and not be limited by functional scope.

## Summary of Approach

### Manual

1. I started by doing a general security and standards audit of the application including some basic penetration testing and WAI comparisons.
I found an array of issues both major and minor with security and accessibility as well as instances of non adherence to the HTTP spec.
My findings from this audit are `./manual/Security and Standards Audit.md`

2. After the audit was complete I needed to define some operating parameters for my manual an automated testing.
I choose a BDD format for describing some implied functional expectations as the syntax is transferable between both manual and automated testing.
My testing specification is `./manual/Functional Testing Spec.md`

3. Once I had the specification I could run my first manual execution, which it did. Results can be found `./manual/Manual Execution - Run 1 (10-11-2018).md`

### Automated

1. I chose to go with Java as a few projects I'm working on are using it and therefore I wouldn't require any refreshment.
In choosing Java the frameworks I advocate (changes from time to time) are Cucumber and Serenity.
I believe that BDD has it's place and serenity provides helpful abstraction to get moving quickly and great reporting, I decided that the screenplay would be overkill for what I was doing.

2. Using the stories defined for the manual testing I created feature files, step libraries and page objects (pretty much in that order) for web testing.
For testing the backend directly I integrated rest assured into steps specifically used to interact with the backend.

## Running the tests

You can run the tests with maven using `mvn verify`. The fail safe plugin is wired up to this lifecycle target.

### Reports

Reports are generated by serenity, they can be found at `./target/site/index.html` once the tests have run.
